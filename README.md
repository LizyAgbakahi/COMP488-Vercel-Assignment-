# Project Title: HealthCare Connect - A Professional Networking Platform for Healthcare Professionals

## Brief Description of my project: 
    HealthCare Connect is a professional networking platform designed specifically for healthcare workers. The site allows medical professionals like doctors, nurses, and healthcare practitioners to connect with colleagues, share knowledge, and access continuing education resources. It features a modern interface with interactive elements including professional networking tools, collaboaration spaces for sharing case studies and best practices, and educational content for ongoing professional development.

## Instructions on how to run the project locally:
    1. Clone the repository to your local machine either through:
    HTTPS git clone https://github.com/LizyAgbakahi/COMP488-Vercel-Assignment-.git 
    SSH git clone git@github.com:LizyAgbakahi/COMP488-Vercel-Assignment-.git 
    2. Open the project folder in your preferred code editor.
    3. Open index.html in a web browser or use a local development server such as Live Server extension in VS Code.

## Technologies used: 
    HTML, CSS and JavaScript, Git, GitHub and Vercel

## Short Reflection on what I learned: 
    This project was really eye-opening for understanding how modern web development works. I have heard of Vercel previously but I never got to work with it. I didn't realize how Git and deployment platforms like Vercel work together. I find it pretty cool that you can push code and it automatically goes live on the internet without any extra steps. The CSS theming was probably the trickiest thing I learned. I had to figure out how CSS variables work and how changing one little attribute on the body tag can completely change how the whole website looks. It took some trial and error to get the dark and light modes working properly. 

    The whole automated deployment aspect of this assignment makes so much sense now. I can see why companies use this workflow. It is truly powerful and time-saving. Being able to make changes and see them live in minutes is way better than having to manually upload files somewhere. It definitely made me feel more confident about web development in general. Most importantly, this project showed me that modern web development involves much more than just writing code. It's about understanding the entire pipeline from development to production, and I'm excited to use these tools in future projects, both personal and academic.
